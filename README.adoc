|In java deserialization is pretty expensive, we can see itâ€™s 100% processor occupation, the size of content to deserialize is critical for performance, the bigger of size, the larger of time. The time and the size are in a linear relations, eg, `time = weight * size`, this tools use to calculate the deserialization weight.
